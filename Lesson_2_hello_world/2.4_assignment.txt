Try to run the following code on your own machine.

    #This script will output the words "Hello World" to the terminal

    #The next line declares a variable
    first_word = "Hello"
    second_word = "World"

    #introduce some logic... if variable first_world is equal to "Hello" then output "Hello World"
    if first_word == "Hello"                            # == means equals and != means not equals
        puts "#{first_word} to the #{second_word} again!"
    else
        puts "You don't like to say hi?"
    end

Try to get the script to output "You don't like to say hi?" into terminal
